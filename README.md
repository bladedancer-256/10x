# 10X Dumping Ground

Keep 10X notes, reports, results, (small) datasets etc. as you wish.
Basically instead of dumping everything in the
[Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EhqPusGRCDKdK5tx5RpEhgwj_LCAi7plb2B62VvbaG4/edit),
feel free to dump it in here.

You can either edit/add files online through GitHub, or clone this
repo locally (`git clone https://github.com/umccr/10x`) and go nuts.
Occasional `git pull`s are recommended. Ask around if you need help ;-)

Just try not to add any 'big' files e.g. > 5Mb. I mean, you _can_, but maybe
you _shouldn't_, since it will take its toll on the repo pulling/pushing
times. I think. Instead you can upload to DropBox or something and
simply link to it on Slack.
